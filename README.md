## Objective

To bring people together at a platform where they are allowed to exchange knowledge with each other in a cooperative way.

## How

Any two members can host a Shastrarth on any agreed upon topic at a scheduled time.

### What happens during a shastrarth?

Basically, when a shastrarth begins, one of the two participants asks the other participant a question related to the topic of Shastrarth.

The Other Participant has to answer the question to continue the Shastrarth.

If the Second Participant answers the question and the First Participant agrees upon the answer.

The Second Participant gets the chance to ask a question related to the topic of Shastrarth.

This continues until any one participant is :
* unable to answer the question

OR
* answers it wrong

But the condition is that,

if the oponent answers the question wrong
* then the participant who asked the question should be able to answer the question and the opponent should accept it to consider the questioner as the winner.
  
else
* the oponent is considered as winner.

In case of any disagreement between the Participants :
* The Shastrarth ends.
* The Shastrarth is termed as Suspended.
